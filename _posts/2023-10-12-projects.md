Current things that are need-to-work on, so that I don't forget:

1. _Site for L._ Have been promising this for a few weeks now, so I should get around to it. **priority 1**.

2. _Hisser colony._ Need to order more. **priority 3**.

3. _This blog._ Would like to work on it more. I think another currently-reading post would be nice. **priority 2**

4. _The zine._ Someone in the FB group mentioned reviving an old one for the house; I'd like to help. **priority 3**.

5. _Figure out classes for next semester._ What I said. **Priority 1**

6. _Run old posts (and this one) through spellcheck so I don't embarass myself rereading them._ That. **priority 2**.

7. _Paint room or door_. Need the HAB hours. **Priority 3**.
