A little list of what I'm currently reading, in the hopes that it means that I'll actually finish them. And because I hope that writing about what I'm reading will help me think about what I read more deeply than just "ok, I like this" or "hmm, I don't like this."

So.

# _The Blighted Stars_ - Megan E. O'Keefe

From the library, pbook (physical book) and ebook (also from the library); I've been switching back and forth based on whether or not I want to carry the largeish physical copy or my (also large-ish) ereader.

Anyway, I've been enjoying this so far! Interesting plot, interesting characters. I like the nature of the disguise/printing system; it feels pretty unique. (This is your chance to instantly think of three or four books that use a very similar system and tell me about it). Worldbuilding has been... okay? Surprisingly understated re: where in the universe/what the planets in it are like, but I think that's just a function of it being a pretty tightly-focused story, geographically speaking. I'm still not totally clear what a "cradle" is as compared to a regular planet (maybe they're the same thing?) but I'm just kind of going with it at this point.

... and that's it, actually! I am usually reading more than one book at a time, but I haven't done laundry recently, and I just finished *Passing Strange* by Ellen Klages, which was the other thing I was reading alongside *The Blighted Stars.*

(Doing laundry is related in that I like to wait in the laundry room until the wash cycle is finished, so I'm less likely to need to wait for a dryer. I either have a designated laundry-room book, or I start new books to see if they're any good.)

In terms of things to read, I checked out *The Outside* (Ada Hoffman), *The Monster Baru Cormorant* (Seth Dickinson) from the library, both of which I've been meaning to read for a while.  One (or more) of those is likely to be up next, and/or *The Dawn of Everything* (which is a strong contender for next laundry-room book, because I like to read nonfiction in smallish chunks).
