So I've enabled comments, powered by giscus github discussions. We'll see if I live to regret it. 

Anyway, I figure this might be an interesting thing to add. I doubt I'll get many people talking to me, but who knows? Maybe one of my one (1) reader will have things to day. Maybe they'll even make a github account to do so!

Who knows.
