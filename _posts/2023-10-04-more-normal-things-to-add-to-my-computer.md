a way to take a screenshot just by pushing a button on the keyboard. (`bindsym Print "exec flameshot gui").

(Flameshot *gui* becaus emuch as I do enjoy using the command line for things, I don't like having to open up a terminal to take a screenshot. It changes the layout of the screen.)

this is also a reminder to myself to back up/clean up my i3 config some time. currently, i've been just adding new lines to the bottom, regardless of what they're actually supposed to do.

I also kind of want to take out comments I don't think I'll need, but that seems like the kiss of death right there. I do that, and I'll suddenly have to edit it from the console while my phone's dead or something, so I can't look up a proper reference. You know the drill.
