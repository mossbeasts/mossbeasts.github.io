I made these a few days ago, and they turned out to be a hit, so I thought I'd write down the recipe.

Make the King Arthur [lemon scones recipe](https://kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/lemon-scones-recipe) with the following modifications:

1. Lemon juice + some zest in the dough instead of lemon oil and lemon juice powder. Reduce yoghurt to 1/4 cup. (Aside from the zest, this is one of their written variations).

2. Throw in a handful of food-grade lavender to the dough, mix in until evenly distributed.

3. Brew a mixture of Earl Grey and more lavendar about 1/2 a cup hot water, to the point where it's strong enough that you don't want to drink it. Use this for the glaze instead of cream and lemon juice. I find it's much easier to add liquid to powdered sugar than powdered sugar to liquid.

4. I threw a handful of candied ginger in the glaze on some of the scones. It was good, but I think left them with a but too much going on. In the future, I think I'll try leaving out the lemon and *just* adding candied ginger, both to the glaze and the dough.

I made this without a stand mixer, so had to crumble the butter by hand. I got it a little too small/soft, but the texture was still fine: a little bit more like a dense coffee cake than a scone, though.
