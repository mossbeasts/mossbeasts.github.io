My first round of midterms is (finally) done! Most of my classes did them late this semester; though 2/3 of the midterm-having classes have more than one the first wasn't 'til almost halfway though the semester. Relaxing for the first few wekks, but it did mean that I had a physics exam one Thursday, Spanish the following Tuesday, and Chem the Wednesday after that. So. A lot in a very small amount of time, especially considering that all those classes are ones that I would have liked to have at least a week to study for on their own. That's a finals-type schedule, though, I suppose I shouldn't expect it for midterms.

The more midterms I take the more I realize that I really do prefer a class structure like that of many of my lab classes - many small assignments, rather than just a few big ones. Unfortunetely, I think that's going to get less and less common the more I continue with college/grad school beyond that. If I get in. If I go.

I'm still deciding on my classes for next semester. Herpetology I have to take, because it's offered every other year and I know the professor's thinking about taking a sabbatical the year after next. I need another gen ed (history), so probably one of those. Wetlands Ecology is being offered; I'll take it if it fits into my schedule. So that's *most* of my units covered (and I am, evidently, less undecided than I think I am), but I will need more than three classes. G and I are planning to see if we can find a plant-focused seminar to take together; that'll be another unit. The only problem is that she doesn't have any priority re: enrollment, so it's a little more up in the air about whether or not we'll be able to get into the same sections.

Still working on declaring, which is to say, I've been *thinking* about working on declaring. It counts. I did make an appointment to talk with a professor-advisor, which is part of the process, so that counts more.---
