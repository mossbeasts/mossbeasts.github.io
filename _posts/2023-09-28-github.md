i hate changing my password. it's probably my worst trait as someone who considers themself reasonably sercurity-savvy, but i just hate changing my password.

what do you mean, i have to *update the entry in my password manager??* how could you be so cruel, random website??

anyway, i think that forcing users to change their passwords really only results in them using weaker, more memorable passwords over all: it's simple to switch back and forth between "mypet123" and "mypet456"; it's more irritating to rewrite a whole entry in your password manager, or re-memorize something like "pHras3that!smeanin6fu112u?!" and keep modifying it.

i read some well-cited article on this somewhere, and have since lost the source, butrest assured in the fact that there's at least one other random internet weirdo who agrees with me.

so there, github "create a new token every 30 days!"
