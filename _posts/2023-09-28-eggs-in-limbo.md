First of all, I'm beginning to think that maybe I should start backdating these posts - I mean, six in one day? What kind of person writes six blog posts in one day?

On the other hand, this is a recipe I posted on my instagram a few weeks ago, and I've been meaning to put it somewhere more... stable since then. As of today, that's the blog!

# Eggs in Limbo
## Obligatory food-blog recipe note
...written mostly just because I like talking about food, and reading people's thoughts on their recipes (I will actually read the preamble to an online recipe, provided it's well-written. I have noticed I seem to be in the minority here, so I don't be *too* offended if you skip my commentary).

Anyway, this came about after I'd been desperately craving eggs in purgatory (think Italian shakshouka) for three days. Unfortunately for me, we had zero (0) canned tomatoes, and no good fresh tomatoes. This was my best attempt at something that was vaguely like eggs in purgatory, using ingredients we actually *had*.

I cook mostly by ratio/feel, so I'm only guessing at proper measurements. To those who like to cook with the tablespoon measure in hand, sorry.

Limbo is a synonym for purgatory (ish), which is where I got the name - the idea is that eggs in limbo can be a sort of synonym for eggs in purgatory. Or maybe just a related word, to strain the metaphor even more.

## Ingredients

- an onion
- spoonful of tomato paste
- slightly smaller spoonful of anchovy paste
- dill
- thyme, oregano, whatever other herbs you'd like.
- a little lemon juice
- some greek yogurt (like one spoonful max)
- an egg
- mushroom
- zucchini
- butter/neutral oil for cooking. whatever you'd like. not PAM though. I don't like it.

## process

1. Heat your oil, add your spices. Give them a minute to bloom, then add your onion. Cook on low 'til it's almost caramelized. While you're doing this, chop up your zucchini and mushroom into pieces that you wouldn't mind eating. When you're done, the onions are probably going to be soft enough that you can just add them right to the pan.
2. Turn up the heat a little (but not too far, you don't want your onion to burn!) and saute everything until it's a good consistency for eating. Check with a fork, if you're not sure.
3. Add your tomato paste and anchovy paste, cook until the tomato paste is either warm or a slightly darker, caramelized red. You could use a non-paste anchovy if you want, and probably wouldn't even have to cut it up. Use your best judgement.
4. Turn the heat back down. Make a little well in the middle of your vegitable mixture, and crack an egg into it. Cover the pan, and let it sit until the egg is as cooked as you want it. This might be hard to judge, given that you're steaming it. I believe in you.
5. Once your egg is how you want it, take everything out of the pan and put it into a bowl. Mix in a little bit of the herbs, if you'd like (especially if you're using fresh ones!), a squeeze of lemon juice, the dill, and a small spoonful of greek yoghurt.
6. mix it all up and enjoy!
