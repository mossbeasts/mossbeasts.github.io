**Point 1:** I don't want this blog to feel like an obligation instead of something I do for fun. This post is an attempt to reenforce that distinction in my head.

**Point 2:** The flurry of activity right after I created this blog is not going to be typical of it, particularily since I want to start doing longer, more in-depth posts. These are <strike>probably</strike> going to require more time and effort to write, so they're going to be less frequent than low-effort posts that I can write at a faster pace. 

**Point 3:** This is not actually a new thing; it's something that I've been thinking about for a few weeks, and a trend I'm already trying to enact.

**Point 4:** I'm probably going to be posting less. This is a post for me to tell myself that that's okay!
