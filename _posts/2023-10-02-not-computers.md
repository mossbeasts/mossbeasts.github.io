Here's the promised not-computers post, which is... not going to be much of one because I'm tired. But. I painted a little with acrylics a few days ago, and it was fun! It's always weird to use them, since they're simultneously very different from watercolors and... well, they're paint. I know how to paint.

I found myself trying to mix colors on the canvas the way I'd mix watercolors on a piece of paper. Ended up looking cool, I think, but also not as smooth as I wanted - there's defenitely places where my colors ended up being a little more streaky than I would have otherwise wanted.

It took me. SO long to get the color of the shallot right, and I'm still not sure it's 100% how I'd want it. I'm proud of the form on the garlic in front, though. I think the little root area turned out well for the amount of detailed brushwork I gave it (almost zero! nearly none at all!).

Anyway, here's the painting.

It'll be bigger if you open it in a new tab.
