Published two posts yesterday. One of them was a real post that failed to show up (that's the thanksgiving salad one); one's a test because I realized that it wasn't showing up. 

I *think* the issue was that I accidentally left their dates as 2023-11-23, instead of 2023-11-22, and I guess gh doesn't like posts that are dated for the future. Going to post this one and see what happens.
