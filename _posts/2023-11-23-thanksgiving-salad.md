It's good.

## You'll need
- butternut squash
- kale (like one bunch)
- blue cheese crumbles
- a pomegranate
- pomegranate molassas or balsamic vinnegar
- olive oil
- an apple
- a few shallots
- salt
- pepper

## To make

1. Peel the squash, cut it into chunks. They should be the size you want them to be in the salad - so about bite size. Drizzle them with olive oil, and a little pomegranate molassas if you're using it, toss them so they're all coated. 
2. Roast the squash. My oven doesn't have a temperature gague, and I tend to just put stuff in until it's done, but my best guess for the procedure would be about an hour at 350F. You want it to be pretty tender, with visible juice on it/on the tray.
    1. I usually do this on a cookie sheet with parchment paper. If you don't have one, you can use pretty much any oven-safe dish/combination of dishes. It is important that you just have one layer of squash, though - if they're piled up, they won't cook evenly. If you're not using parchment paper, put a little butter or oil in with them so they don't stick.
    2. This is where you can stop, if you're making it ahead.
3. Chop/tear the kale into bite sized pieces. Add in a little salt - maybe a teaspoon? Once again, I didn't measure. and a little olive oil. Reach into the bowl, and kind of squish the kale until it's slightly darker in color, and more tender. If you're unsure, just eat a little bit. If you like the texture, stop there. If you don't, massage it ore.
4. Slice shallots thin, and cube the apples. Get the seeds out of the pomegranate. Put all that stuff on top of the kale.
5. If you want, add some nuts. I did hazelnuts, pecans would also be good. I think those spicy candied pecans from Trader Joes would be really good.
6. Put some more olive oil and your pomegranate molasses/vinegar into a bowl. Whisk until it's at least slightly emulsified. Pour it onto the salad, toss everything together.
7. Salt + pepper to taste. You don't need a lot, but a little will make the salad a lot better.
