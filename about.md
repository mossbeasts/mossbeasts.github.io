This website was created with mossbeasts' [blog skeletonizer](https://github.com/mossbeasts/blog-skeletonizer"), a simple template/framework/sandbox to create a personal website with github pages. Feel free to use it if you'd like, and to send me any questions you may have by submitting an issue on the github repo linked above.
