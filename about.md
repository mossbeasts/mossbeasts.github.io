mossbeasts are tardigrades.

i promise this site won't be quiiite this eye-searing when it's no longer under construction.

expect: moss, beasts, mossbeasts, computers, food, the occasional piece of fiction, the less-ocasional moaning about the process of writing, watercolor, other art.

don't expect: consistency.
