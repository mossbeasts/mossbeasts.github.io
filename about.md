<b>expect:</b> moss, beasts, mossbeasts (me!), computers, food, books, watercolor, other art, talking about art, talking about this blog, talking about randpm things that I happen to think of. As someone whose CS skills are 100% self-taught or from friends, I'm passionate about making information on computers and CS easy for people who are "bad at computers" or don't have any CS/webdev experience to find, read, and understand. To that end, there will probably be a fair number of basic how-to articles and documentation.

This website was created with mossbeasts' [blog skeletonizer]("https://github.com/mossbeasts/blog-skeletonizer"), a simple template/framework/sandbox to create a personal website with github pages. Feel free to use it if you'd like, and to send me any questions you may have by submitting an issue on the github repo linked above.
